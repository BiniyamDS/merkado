# Merkado
A simple e-commerce application that caters to two types of users: Sellers and Buyers. Sellers can register, log in, set up their store, manage products (add, edit, delete), track received orders, and update order statuses (Pending, Shipped, Delivered). Buyers, on the other hand, can register, log in, browse products across all sellers, add items to cart, complete checkout, view order history, track order status, cancel orders, and explore seller profiles along with their products.
